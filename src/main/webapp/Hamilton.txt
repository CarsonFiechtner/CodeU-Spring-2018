How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a 
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
 
Spot in the Caribbean by Providence, impoverished, in squalor 

Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?
 
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
 Got a lot farther by workin a lot harder 

By bein a lot smarter
By bein a self-starter
 By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter 

And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted 

Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up 

Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of 
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter 

Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, drippin down the drain
 
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
 And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain
